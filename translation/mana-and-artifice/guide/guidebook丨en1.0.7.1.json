However, I can think of several aspects of spells that could be modified.  I'll need to add in modifiers to the equation of the spell so that I can change these values.\n\nWhen my spell is all written out the way I want it, I'll need to give the arcane ash time to imbue the ink into an actual spell recipe and allow the ritual that follows to create the actual spell.
